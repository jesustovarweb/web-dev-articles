# Remove default product tabs in WooCommerce

## What it does

This snippet removes one or more of the default tabs displayed on the WooCommerce single product page: Description, Reviews and Additional information.

It works by filtering the list of product tabs generated by WooCommerce and removing the ones that are not needed before they are rendered on the page.

## Where to put it

You can place this snippet in one of the following locations:

- The `functions.php` file of your theme (preferably a child theme)
- A custom utility plugin
- A code snippets plugin, for simple setups

## How to customize

The snippet uses a predefined list of tab identifiers to decide which tabs should be removed.

To customize the behaviour, you simply need to edit that list and add or remove the identifiers corresponding to the tabs you want to hide.  
For example, you can choose to remove only the reviews tab, or keep the description and remove the rest.

## Notes

- Some themes override or rebuild the product tabs using custom templates or block-based layouts. In those cases, this snippet may not have any effect.
- Before removing product tabs, make sure the information they contain is displayed elsewhere if it is relevant for SEO or user experience.
- Grouping all tab removals in a single function makes future maintenance easier and avoids duplicated code.
