# WordPress

This directory contains code examples and snippets related to WordPress, extracted from articles published on my website and based on real-world development scenarios.

The goal is not to cover every aspect of WordPress, but to document specific solutions that are still valid, maintainable and relevant in professional projects today.

## Organization

Examples are grouped by context or plugin when it makes sense:

- `core/`  
  Snippets and adjustments that affect WordPress core behaviour and do not depend on specific plugins.

- Plugin-specific directories (for example, `woocommerce/`, `wpml/`, etc.)  
  Customizations related to plugins commonly used in real projects.

Each example lives in its own directory and includes its own README with an explanation and a link to the original article it comes from.

## Selection criteria

Not all the code shown in the blog articles is automatically published here.

Only examples that:

- Represent a professional way of working today.
- Can be safely reused in other projects.
- Make sense outside the full context of the original articlebare included in this directory.

Other code is intentionally kept only as part of the editorial content.
