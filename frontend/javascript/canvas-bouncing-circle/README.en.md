# Bouncing circle animation using canvas

This example shows how to animate a circle inside an HTML canvas element using JavaScript, making it bounce against the canvas boundaries.

The goal of this snippet is not to provide a full introduction to the canvas API, but to offer a clean and functional base that can be used to build more complex animations.

## What it does

- Draws a circle inside an HTML canvas
- Updates its position on each frame
- Detects collisions with the canvas edges
- Reverses movement direction when boundaries are reached
- Uses a browser-friendly animation loop for real-time graphics

## Where this example fits

This snippet can be used as a starting point for:

- Simple canvas animations.
- Basic games or simulations.
- Dynamic visualizations.
- Canvas-based proof of concepts.

It reflects a common way of working with canvas in real-world projects, keeping structure, logic and animation clearly separated.

## Notes

- The example uses a browser refresh–based animation loop, which is more suitable for canvas graphics than generic timers.
- The code is designed to be easy to extend: speed, size, number of objects or collision behaviour.
- No external controls or configuration are included to keep the example focused and readable.
