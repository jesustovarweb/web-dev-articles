# Frontend

This directory contains frontend-related code examples and snippets based on articles published on my blog and on real needs encountered in professional projects.

The goal is not to collect generic HTML, CSS or JavaScript examples, but to document concrete solutions, common patterns and approaches that are still valid and maintainable today.

## Scope

You may find examples related to:

- HTML structure and markup.
- CSS styling and layout.
- JavaScript behaviour and interactions.
- Browser APIs.
- Animations, canvas and 2D graphics.
- Proofs of concept and reusable technical bases.

Examples are not intended as step-by-step tutorials, but as clean and functional technical references.

## Organization

Examples are grouped by technology or context when it makes sense, and each one lives in its own directory.

Every example includes its own README explaining what it does, where it fits and which article it comes from.

## Selection criteria

Only examples that:

- Originate from real frontend development problems.
- Can be understood and reused outside the full article context.
- Represent a professional way of working today are included here.

Overly basic, purely educational or explanation-dependent examples are intentionally kept only in the blog.

## Notes

Code is usually written and commented in English, following common development conventions, even if the main repository documentation is written in Spanish.
