# Tools

This directory contains auxiliary tools and utilities related to web development, created or adapted to solve specific needs in real-world projects.

Unlike other directories in this repository, this one does not contain code snippets intended to be directly integrated into a project. Instead, it includes one-off tools and helpers used during development, maintenance or technical analysis tasks.

## What you will find here

This directory may include, for example:

- One-off scripts or command-line tools
- Utilities for debugging, migrations or repetitive tasks
- Internal tools created to solve a specific problem
- Small helpers or mini-projects that do not fit into frontend, backend or WordPress directories

The focus is always practical and problem-driven, not on building generic tools without a clear use case.

## Inclusion criteria

Only tools that:
- have been used in real projects,
- provide value as a technical reference,
- and make sense outside the exact context in which they were created are included here.

Tools that are too specific or hard to reuse are intentionally left out.

## Documentation

Each tool lives in its own directory and includes a README explaining its purpose, usage and context, along with a link to the original blog article when applicable.
